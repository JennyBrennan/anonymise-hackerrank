# Anonymise HackerRank

A Chrome extension to hide names and emails in HackerRank coding exercise results pages, to reduce bias.

### How to install

1. Download this folder
2. Go to chrome://extensions and check the 'Developer mode' checkbox in the top right hand corner
3. Click 'Load an unpacked extension...' and select the `anonymise-hackerrank` folder you've downloaded onto your computer to install the extension

## How does it work?

Once you've activated the Chrome Extension, it will automatically hide the name and email fields in the HackerRank coding test results.

I recommend combining this with an anonymised list of links and candidate numbers, with space to take notes if you're not taking action in the UI itself, or asking recruiters to send links without names in emails. If you're using a different workflow that needs more of the HackerRank UI anonymised - pull requests welcome!
